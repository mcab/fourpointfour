# Four Point Four

With [CSE 4400](https://catalog.uconn.edu/cse/#4400) not being offered for 
this upcoming Spring 2019 semester, a group of undergraduates came together
in order to try and make a curriculum of their own.

This is that repo.

## Purpose

On UConn's Undergraduate Catalog, there's a brief summary for what this class
will cover.

> Computer security and the design of secure systems. Cryptographic tools.
> Operating system security and access control. Network, software and database
> security. Randomness generation. Malicious software. Anonymity and privacy.
> Various attacks and countermeasures. Ethical, legal and business aspects.

That's a lot to cover in just one semester. Our intent is to generate the
material used in future 4400 classes, so it's not forever stuck in limbo.

## Format

There's roughly fourteen sessions to cover. Each session, a student (or
professor) chooses from a list of topics to cover, and leads the next class
on what topic was chosen.

Roughly, a class session goes as such:

- 15 minutes of introduction (of the topic chosen)
- 1 hour discussion/activity
    - How to defend against such attack
    - How to utilize said attack
- 15 minutes of break
- 30 minutes of "where this has gone/will go"

This means two presentation slots per person, fifteen minutes of "prepared"
discussion, and a slide set/paper/activity that will be done during that
session. It's run akin to a graduate level course.

## Topics

This is the tentative list of topics.

1. Reverse engineering
    - [Buffer overflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow)
    - [Return-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming)
    - [Canaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection#Canaries)
    - [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)

2. Sandboxing/Containers
    - Cache attacks/lookahead

3. Timing channels

4. [SELinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux)

5. Database security

6. Mobile security

7. Malware

8. How to write good code
