# Security Research

This is some (independent) security research I've done. 

## CSE 4400

Contains the presentations I've made and presented on for a independent study in my senior year of college. There were five others (including a professor), twelve weeks, so we split it two per person. I presented on buffer overflow defenses and mobile security.

Inside each folder, there are slides, notes per slide on what was discussed, and sample code on what we used.
