# Week 10

## Mobile Security

The Powerpoint should have all the notes per slides, while the code/ folder
should have the example code.

`FlagBruteForce.java` was used to reverse engineer `babyrev.apk`, after decompiling with jadx.

The Powerpoint also addresses this as "The Mobile Landscape," which should be kept in mind for this lesson. If this is to evolve into a lesson about mobile security, more emphasis should be put into permissions and how data is protected. If it's a lesson about mobile architecture, more emphasis should be put into underlying hardware and how the mobile operating system is different from PC operating systems.
